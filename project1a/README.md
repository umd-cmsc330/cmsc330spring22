# Project 1a: Ruby Warmup

Due: February 2, 2022 at 11:59 PM (late February 3, *10% penalty*). **Note the deadline: just over one week**

Points: 80 public, 20 semipublic

**This is an individual assignment. You must work on this project alone.**

## Before You Start

**If you have not yet completed [project 0](../project0), you should do so before starting this project.**  At the very least, you should have everything related to Ruby installed correctly.  If you have any trouble with installation, check Piazza (or create a post if you don't find your problem there), or come to office hours to get help from a TA.

## Introduction
This project aims to give you some experience with basic Ruby functionality, including using basic data types (integers, strings), collections (arrays and hashes), and classes. You will also become familiar with Ruby's basic control constructs for looping and conditional execution, and how to run Ruby unit tests.

## Getting New Projects
You should have cloned the repository in project 0.  To download new projects (such as this one), go to the cloned repo in your terminal and run `git pull`.  This will download the files for this project and update your cloned repository.

## Submitting
You will submit this the same way you submitted project 0: by running `gradescope-submit` in the `project1a` folder.  If you are unable to get this to work, you can just submit both files in the src/ directory manually to the assignment on Gradescope.

## A Note on Types
Ruby has no built-in way to restrict the types passed to methods. As such, all method types specified in this document are the only ones you need to handle. You may assume that no arguments will be passed outside of the types we specify, and your program may do anything in cases where improperly typed arguments are passed. This is undefined behavior for this program and **will not be tested**.

The expected types will be represented in the following format at the beginning of each section:

```ruby
(String) -> Array or nil
```

The left-hand side of the arrow specifies the parameter types, and the right-hand side specifies the return type. This example describes a method that takes a single `String` as an argument and either returns an `Array` or `nil`. When implementing a method with this signature, you may assume that a `String` will be passed in and you are responsible for ensuring that *only* a `Array` or `nil` is returned. (Since Ruby is object oriented, the signature also means that a subclass of `String` could be passed in, and that a subclass of `Array` could be returned.)

**Note**: Some shorthand is used to avoid verbosity in type siguatures; namely:
- `Integer` is used to refer to either `Fixnum` or `Bignum` (i.e., we can think of `Integer` as a superclass of these two).
- `Bool` is used to refer to the either `TrueClass` or `FalseClass`.
- `nil` is used to refer to `NilClass`.

# Part 1 (Warm-up)
Implement part 1 in `warmup.rb`. Each of the methods you must implement are described below. We provide you with the signature of each method and a description of its required behavior. For some methods, we state assumptions that you can make about the input. In these cases, it doesn't matter what your code does if the assumption isn't met, since we will never run a test case that contradicts the assumption.

#### `fib(n)`
- **Description**: Returns the first `n` [fibonacci numbers](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20longer%20list,196418%2C%20317811%2C%20...).
- **Type**: `(Integer) -> Array`
- **Assumptions**: `n` is non-negative.
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  fib(0) == []
  fib(1) == [0]
  fib(2) == [0, 1]
  fib(3) == [0, 1, 1]
  fib(10) == [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
  ```

#### `isPalindrome(n)`
- **Description**: Returns `true` if `n` is a palindrome and `false` otherwise. A palindrome is the same read forward and backward.
- **Type**: `(Integer) -> Bool`
- **Assumptions**: `n` is non-negative; `n` will not be provided with any leading 0s.
- **Hint**: It may be easier to do this after converting the provided integer to a String.
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  isPalindrome(0) == true
  isPalindrom(1) == true
  isPalindrome(10) == false
  isPalindrome(101) == true
  isPalindrome(120210) == false
  ```

#### `nthmax(n, a)`
- **Description**: Returns the `n`th largest value in the array `a` or `nil` if it does not exist. That the largest value is specified using n = 0.
- **Type**: `(Integer, Array) -> Integer or nil`
- **Assumptions**: `n` is non-negative.
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  nthmax(0, [1,2,3,0]) == 3
  nthmax(1, [3,2,1,0]) == 2
  nthmax(2, [7,3,4,5]) == 4
  nthmax(5, [1,2,3]) == nil
  ```

#### `freq(s)`
- **Description**: Returns a one-character string containing the character that occurs with the highest frequency within 's'. If `s` has no characters, it should return the empty string.
- **Type**: `(String) -> String`
- **Assumptions**: Only one character will have the highest frequency (i.e. there will be no "ties").
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  freq("") == ""
  freq("aaabb") == "a"
  freq("bbaaa") == "a"
  freq("ssabcd") == "s"
  freq("a12xxxxxyyyxyxyxy") == "x"
  ```

#### `zipHash(arr1, arr2)`
- **Description**: Returns a hash that maps corresponding elements in `arr1` and `arr2`, i.e., `arr1[i]` maps to `arr2[i]`, for all i. If the two arrays are not the same length, return `nil`.
- **Type**: `(Array, Array) -> Hash or nil`
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  zipHash([], []) == {}
  zipHash([1], [2]) == {1 => 2}
  zipHash([1, 5], [2, 4]) == {1 => 2, 5 => 4}
  zipHash([1], [2, 3]) == nil
  zipHash(["Mamat", "Hicks", "Vinnie"], ["prof", "prof", "TA"]) == {"Mamat" => "prof", "Hicks" => "prof", "Vinnie" => "TA"}
  ```

#### `hashToArray(hash)`
- **Description**: Returns an array of arrays; each element of the returned array is a two-element array where the first item is a key from the hash and the second item is its corresponding value. The entries in the returned array must be sorted in the same order as they appear in `hash.keys`.
- **Type**: `(Hash) -> Array`
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  hashToArray({}) == []
  hashToArray({"a" => "b"}) == [["a", "b"]]
  hashToArray({"a" => "b", 1 => 2}) == [["a", "b"], [1, 2]]
  hashToArray({"x" => "v", "y" => "w", "z" => "u"}) == [["x", "v"], ["y", "w"], ["z", "u"]]
  ```

# Part 2 (PhoneBook class)
In part 2, you will be implementing a PhoneBook class. It is up to you to decide how to store the data (i.e., how to define a phonebook instance's fields) so that you can correctly implement all the required methods.

Even though the data structure you will implement is up to you, keep the following in mind:
- The Phonebook will hold names and phone numbers, as well as a note on whether each name and phone number pair is **listed** or not.
- By listed, we mean that they are marked as so (not simply stored). You might want to use a boolean to determine it so.
- The Phonebook might contain listed and unlisted entries. How you should add them will be specified in the `add` method below.


#### `initialize`
- **Description**: This is the constructor. You should initialize the fields that you think your class needs for successful evaluation of the remaining methods. We do not test the constructor directly, but we do test it indirectly by testing the remaining methods.

#### `add(name, number, is_listed)`
- **Description**: This method attempts to add a new entry to the PhoneBook. `name` is the name of the person and `number` is that person's phone number. The `is\_listed` parameter identifies if this entry should be listed or unlisted in the PhoneBook (`true` if listed, `false` if unlisted). Return `true` if the operation was successful, and `false` otherwise. Here are the **requirements** for the add method:
    - If the person already exists, then the entry cannot be added to the PhoneBook.
    - If `number` is not in the format `NNN-NNN-NNNN`, the entry cannot be added to the PhoneBook.
    - A `number` can be added as *unlisted* any number of times, but can only be added as *listed* once. This means that if `number` already exists and is *listed* in the PhoneBook, the new entry can only be added if the entry will be *unlisted*.

- **Type**: `(String, String, Bool) -> Bool`
- **Assumptions**: No phone number will start with 0.
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  @phonebook = PhoneBook.new
  @phonebook.add("John", "110-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jane", "220-134-1312", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("John", "110-192-1862", false) == false
  @phonebook.add("Ravi", "110", true) == false
  ```
  
  Here is another example:
  
  ```ruby
  @phonebook2 = PhoneBook.new
  @phonebook2.add("Alice", "120-345-6789", false) == true
  @phonebook2.add("Bob", "120-345-6789", false) == true
  @phonebook2.add("Eve", "120-345-6789", true) == true
  @phonebook2.add("Rob", "120-345-6789", true) == false
  @phonebook2.add("Johnny B. Good", "120-345-6789", false) == true
  ```

#### `lookup(name)`
- **Description**: Looks up `name` in the `PhoneBook` and returns the corresponding phone number in the format `NNN-NNN-NNNN` ONLY if the entry is listed. Otherwise, return `nil`.
- **Type**: `(String) -> String or nil`
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  @phonebook = PhoneBook.new
  @phonebook.add("John", "110-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jane", "220-134-1312", true) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jack", "114-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jessie", "410-124-1131", true) == true
  @phonebook.add("Ravi", "110", true) == false

  @phonebook.lookup("John") == nil
  @phonebook.lookup("Jack") == nil
  @phonebook.lookup("Jane") == "220-134-1312"
  @phonebook.lookup("Jessie") == "410-124-1131"
  @phonebook.lookup("Ravi") == nil
  ```

#### `lookupByNum(num)`
- **Description**: Returns the name associated with a given number *only* if the entry is listed. Otherwise, return `nil`.
- **Type**: `(String) -> String or nil`
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  @phonebook = PhoneBook.new
  @phonebook.add("John", "110-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jane", "220-134-1312", true) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jack", "114-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jessie", "410-124-1131", true) == true

  @phonebook.lookupByNum("110-192-1862") == nil
  @phonebook.lookupByNum("114-192-1862") == nil
  @phonebook.lookupByNum("220-134-1312") == "Jane"
  @phonebook.lookupByNum("410-124-1131") == "Jessie"
  ```

#### `namesByAc(areacode)`
- **Description**: Returns an array of all names in the `PhoneBook` who have phone numbers beginning with `areacode`, *including unlisted names*.
- **Type**: `(String) -> Array`
- **Examples**:
  ```ruby
  @phonebook = PhoneBook.new
  @phonebook.add("John", "110-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jane", "220-134-1312", true) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jack", "114-192-1862", false) == true
  @phonebook.add("Jessie", "110-124-1131", true) == true
  # Note that Jessie's number here is a little different than in the other examples!

  @phonebook.namesByAc("110") == ["John", "Jessie"]
  @phonebook.namesByAc("114") == ["Jack"]
  @phonebook.namesByAc("111") == []
  ```
